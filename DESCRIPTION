Description: Marble Circuit is a puzzle game made by MindWare that has 64 
    challenge cards with 2 to 10 tiles missing. The goal for the player is to
    determine where the missing tiles should be placed so that the 8 marbles 
    running down the puzzle will accumulate in the targets as indicated on the
    challenge card. This package provides functionality to determine challenge
    difficulty.
